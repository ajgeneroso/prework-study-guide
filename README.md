# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This Prework Study Guide is a great help to starting to learn how to code and build websites. This Prework Study Guide helped me prove to myself if I could make a website. I learned how to work in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used to help throughout the whole bootcamp as it has notes to help. There are not for HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript to help when stuck or if you can't remember something. Also you can use the DevTools from the website and see JavaScript is running to help because it will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for us to study first

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
